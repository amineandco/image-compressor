This project is a simple Python script to compress images, particularly JPEG, PNG, and other common formats. It allows users to reduce the file size of images while maintaining quality.

## Features
- Compress JPEG and PNG images.
- User-friendly interface using `easygui`.
- Allows the user to specify the quality of JPEG images on a scale from 10 to 100.
- Creates a `compressed` folder to store the compressed images.

## How to Use
1. Run the `compress.py` script.
2. Select the image you want to compress.
3. For JPEG images, enter the desired quality (between 10 and 100).
4. The compressed image will be saved in the `compressed` folder.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL) library
- easygui library
